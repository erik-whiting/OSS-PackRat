class Connection:

    This is the main database connection class.

    As of right now, OSS PackRat only supports Postgres
    RDBMS. Also, the project does not use a 3rd party
    ORM because at the time of development, that seemed
    like overkill, and rolling our own ORM works fine
    for our purposes.

        """
        Constructs an instance of the connection class. This class
        assumes that you have already created a database called
        OSSPackRat. If you named your database something else, all
        you have to do is pass the name to the constructor as a
        string. This class also assumes you want to log all your
        errors to a CSV file called db_error_log.csv at the project
        root level.

        Please note, this class assumes that you have the following
        environment variables set:

        PSQL_USER     : The user of your postgres instance
        PSQL_PASSWORD : The postgres user's password
        DB_HOST       : The host name of your database

        If these are not set, no connection will be established.

        Parameters
        ----------
        db_name : str, OSSPackRat
            The name of the database you're using. The default
            value is OSSPackRat, so if you've named the database
            something else, just pass that name as a string to
            the constructor.

        error_log : str, db_error_log.csv

        Examples
        --------
        # For databases named OSSPackRat
        connection = Connection()
        # For databases named something else
